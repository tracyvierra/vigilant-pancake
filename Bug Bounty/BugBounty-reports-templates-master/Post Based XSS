#introduction

There is an Post based XSS on <TargetURL> Which can be used to run JavaScript inside the context of your domain.

#Description
I found an Endpoint <TargetURL>
Which takes POST base input email and password.

<Param1>
<Param2>

I noticed that the values of those input are reflect back into the values of the java-script variables without any
validation So one can perform post based XSS which will run within the context of your domain.

#Scope of an Attack:
It effects both the authenticated and Un-authenticated Users.

#Impact
The attacker could of course inject the above attack into his website and third-party application via a stored
XSS bug/Melicious Page. The form is submitted cross-domain (as in a cross-site request forgery attack), but the
resulting payload executes within the security context of the vulnerable application, enabling the full range of
standard XSS attack actions to be performed.
