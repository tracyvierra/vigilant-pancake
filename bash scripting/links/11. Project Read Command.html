<h4>Read Command Project Brief</h4><p><strong>Please view this article in full-screen mode, or download the attached PDF</strong></p><h4>Scenario</h4><p>You are setting up a new switchboard for your company's phone system. You need to collect everyoneâ€™s current extension numbers and the pin code that they want to use when making calls.</p><p>Because there is no internal phone, you decide to write a bash script to request this information from each of your colleagues, and write it to a csv file to process later.</p><h4>Your Task</h4><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Firstly you can create a script called <code>get_extensions</code>.</p><p>In this script you will need to ask your user for 4 pieces of information using the <code>read</code> command.</p><ol><li><p>What is your first name?:</p></li><li><p>What is your surname/family name?:</p></li><li><p>What is your extension number?:</p></li><li><p>What access code would you like to use when dialing in?:</p></li></ol><p>You must advise the user that their extension number and access code must both be exactly 4 digits long.</p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> You should ensure that the extension and pin numbers are exactly 4 digits long. Check out the <code>-N</code> option in the <code>read</code> command documentation, which you can access by running the command <code>help read</code></p><p><strong><em>Hint:</em></strong> When entering private information like access codes, it is always better to prevent what the user types from appearing in the terminal.</p><p><strong><em>Hint:</em></strong><em> Use the echo command to add blank lines where necessary to nicely format the user interface.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>Using the <code>echo</code> command you then need to save this information to a file called <code>extensions.csv</code> in the following format:</p><p><code>firstname,lastname,extension,access</code></p><p>Saving the data like this will make it possible to open the data in Microsoft Excel or some other spreadsheet software for processing (try it out!)<br><br><strong><em>Hint:</em></strong> Make sure that the script appends data to the extensions.csv file each time the script is run.</p><p><br></p>
