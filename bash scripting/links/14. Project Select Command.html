<h4>Select Command Project Brief</h4><p><strong>Please view this article in full-screen mode, or download the attached PDF</strong></p><h4>Scenario</h4><p>You have realised that there is some additional information that you need from your users to be able to effectively set up your switchboard.</p><p>Firstly, you need to provide your users with a new phone to work with the new system and you would like to give your users the option to have either a handheld phone or a headset phone.</p><p>Secondly you need to know which department they are in within the company.</p><h4>Your Task</h4><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You will build on the <code>get_extensions</code> script that you created previously to do this (if you’ve forgotten, please see the project for the <code>read</code> command)</p><p>A copy of the official solution for the <code>read</code> command project has been placed in the resources section of this video, so begin by downloading that, renaming it appropriately, and opening it in nano.</p><p>After asking the user for their last name, you will need to add in two <code>select</code> commands.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your first <code>select</code> command will set a variable for the type of phone with the options “headset” and “handheld” given to the user.</p><p>Use the <code>PS3</code> shell variable to give the user an appropriate prompt.</p><p>You will then <code>echo</code> out to the user their selection.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Then you need to add in another <code>select</code> command to ask the user for their department. Give the user the options of: “finance”, “sales”, “customer service”, and “engineering”.</p><p>Again, use the <code>PS3</code> shell variable to give the user an appropriate prompt, and echo out their selection to them.</p><p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Finally you need to modify the <code>echo</code> command at the end of the script to make sure that the new data is written to the data file.</p><p><em>Hint: </em>Remember to use <code>break</code> to end each <code>select</code> command.</p>
