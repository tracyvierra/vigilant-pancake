<h4>How Bash Processes Command Lines</h4><h4>Problem Set Brief</h4><p><br></p><p><strong>Please view this article in full-screen mode, or download the attached PDF</strong></p><p>In this brief there are 5 sets of command lines.</p><p>Please work through each example like I have done in the worked examples, listing each step of the process out and what the result of that step will be.</p><p>Once you are done you can refer to the worked solutions pdf to see the answers and see how you did!</p><h4>Problem 1</h4><p><code>echo “The number $(( 5-2 ))” &gt; number.txt</code></p><h4>Problem 2</h4><p><code>ls /etc | grep net &gt; net.txt</code></p><p><br></p><h4>Problem 3</h4><pre class="prettyprint linenums">#/bin/bash
IFS=,
folder=people
name=john,jane,abhishek
mkdir $folder &amp;&amp; cd $folder &amp;&amp; touch $name</pre><p><br></p><p><strong>Useful Note 1:</strong> Shebang lines and variable assignments are not processed in the same way. Just skip these lines.</p><p><br><strong>Useful Note 2:</strong> Don’t worry about the meaning of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, just focus on how the command line would be processed (<code>&amp;&amp;</code> is a control operator).</p><h4>Problem 4</h4><p><code>touch “Daily Report $(date +”%a %d %h %y”)”</code></p><p><br></p>
