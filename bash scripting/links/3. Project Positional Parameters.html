<h4>Positional Parameters Project Brief</h4><p><strong>Please view this article in full-screen mode, or download the attached PDF</strong></p><h4>Scenario</h4><p>You have been asked to create a bash script that will serve as a basic calculator and allow you to perform simple arithmetic calculations from the command line.</p><p>The calculator needs to be able to do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, on a maximum of 9 numbers.</p><p>The first command line argument given to the script will contain the operation that is to be performed on the numbers (either + or -).</p><p>The operation chosen will be applied to all the numbers.</p><p>For example, if the first command line argument is “+”, then all the other command line arguments will be added together. If the user picks “-”, then all the other command line arguments will be subtracted from each other, and so on.</p><p>Your script needs to be able to accept the operation as the first command line argument, and also accept up to 9 numbers (for a total of 10 command line arguments).</p><p><strong><em>Hint 1:</em></strong><em> </em>You will need to use the first positional parameter, which is the operator, multiple times</p><p><strong><em>Hint 2:</em></strong><em> </em>You can use the echo command to display the result of the arithmetic expansion</p><p><strong><em>Hint 3:</em></strong> <br>+ and - , like all binary operators, require there to be an operand before and after the operator. “1 +” and “2 -” on their own don’t make any sense.</p><p>Given this, what would you do if the user only wanted to add 4 numbers, for example?<br><br>To get around this issue, consider how you might use a parameter expansion trick like <code>${parameter:-word}</code> to substitute a default value if a given positional parameter is not provided.<br><br>You can refer to the GNU Bash Manual for clarity on the usage of this particular parameter expansion trick: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Expansions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Expansions</a></p><p><br></p>
