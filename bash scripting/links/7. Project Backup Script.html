<h4>Backup Script Project Brief</h4><p><strong>Please view this article in full-screen mode, or download the attached PDF</strong></p><h4>Scenario</h4><p>Your boss has noticed that you do some very valuable work for the company, and, to ensure it doesn't get lost, they have suggested that you create a script that you can use to easily backup all the files in your home directory.</p><p>Your boss also thinks that this script will be very useful for others in the office, and wants you to make sure the script is professionally formatted before sharing it with your colleagues.</p><h4>Your Task</h4><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a bash script called <code>backup_script</code> in your <code>~/bash_course/</code> directory.</p><p>This script should backup all the files in your home directory and save them all in a <code>.tar</code> archive<strong>. Guidance is provided below on how to do this.</strong></p><p>When writing your script, remember to add all the core components of your script:</p><ol><li><p>The “Shebang” line</p></li><li><p>Commands (<strong>see the "extra guidance" section below</strong>)</p></li><li><p>An exit statement with an appropriate exit code.</p></li></ol><p>As well as the 5 pieces of professional information:</p><ol><li><p>Author</p></li><li><p>Date Created</p></li><li><p>Last Modified</p></li><li><p>Description</p></li><li><p>Usage</p></li></ol><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the script the correct permissions.</p><p>Because the script will be shared with others in your organisation, your script should have the following permissions:</p><ul><li><p>The file owner (i.e you) should have read, write, and execute permissions.</p></li><li><p>Everyone in the file’s group (i.e. your colleagues) should have read and execute permissions. For security purposes, they should not have write permissions.</p></li><li><p>Everyone else in the organisation should only have read permissions.</p></li></ul><p>Use<a href="http://permissions-calculator.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> permissions-calculator.org/</a> to figure out the correct octal code to use with the <code>chmod</code> command to achieve this.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Run your script multiple times to check that it's working.</p><p>You should see it creating multiple backups for you in your <code>~/bash_course</code> folder.</p><h4>Extra Guidance</h4><p>To build this script, you are going to use the <code>tar</code><strong> </strong>command.</p><p>If the <code>tar</code><strong> </strong>command is new to you, don't worry! All you need to know is that the tar command is used to create <strong>.tar</strong> archives, which are basically <strong>.zip</strong> files, but more “Linuxy”.</p><p>Right now, we just want you to use the tar<strong> </strong>command to practice building professional scripts.</p><p>Your script will use the below command (feel free to copy and paste it):</p><p><code>tar -cvf ~/bash_course/my_backup_"$(date +%d-%m-%Y_%H-%M-%S)".tar ~/* 2&gt;/dev/null</code></p><p>This command takes the contents of your home directory, compresses it into a <code>.tar</code> archive, and saves that archive into the <code>~/bash_course</code> folder.</p><p>The command also names the backup according to the current date and time. For example, a backup made on the 12th July 2020 at 12:00:00 (midday) would be saved as <code>my_backup_12-07-2020_12-00-00.tar</code></p>
