<h4>Project Brief: Improved Backup Script</h4><p><strong>Please view this article in full-screen mode, or download the attached PDF</strong></p><h4>Scenario</h4><p>You have been using your backup script at work for some time now, and you have discovered a few issues that you would like to address.</p><p>Firstly, your script is not giving any output to the user. It would be nice to tell the user that the script is running to give them a bit of reassurance that their valuable data is indeed being backed up.</p><p>Secondly, some of your colleagues struggle to use the script because they do not have a <code>bash_course</code> directory on their system. To get around this issue, you want to modify the script so that it creates a backup in whatever directory the user runs the script from.</p><h4>Your Task</h4><p>This project involves five steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Edit the <code>backup_script</code> to print out the following two lines to the user’s screen when the script is run:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">Hello, &lt;User&gt;
I will now back up your home directory, &lt;/path/to/home_directory&gt;</pre><p>For example:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">Hello, Simon
I will now back up your home directory, /home/simon/</pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> The user’s username should have the first letter capitalised in the first line of the greeting message.</p><p><em><br></em><strong><em>Hint 1</em>:</strong> You can use the <code>echo</code> command and shell variables to achieve this.</p><p><strong><em>Hint 2</em>: </strong>Look at the lecture on “shell parameter expansion tricks” to see how to capitalise the first letter of the user’s username.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create a variable called <code>currentdir</code> and store in it the value returned by the <code>pwd</code> command.</p><p><br></p><p>The <code>pwd</code> command simply shows the path to the user’s current working directory (i.e. the directory that they run the script from).</p><p><em>Hint</em>: You will need to use command substitution to achieve this.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p><p>Use the echo command and the <code>currentdir</code> variable to tell the user where they have run the script from, and thus where their backup will be saved:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">You are running this script from &lt;current_directory&gt;.
Therefore, I will save the backup in &lt;current_directory&gt;</pre><p>e.g.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">You are running this script from /home/simon/bash_course
Therefore, I will save the backup in /home/simon/bash_course</pre><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Edit the <code>tar</code> command so that it backs up the user’s home directory in the directory held by the <code>currentdir</code> variable.</p><p>Note that the verbose (<code>-v</code>) option should also be removed from the <code>tar</code> command so that the <code>echo</code> statements are easily visible to the user.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Add a final line so that the script tells the user that the backup has completed</p><p>e.g.</p><p><code>Backup Completed Successfully.</code></p><p><br></p>
